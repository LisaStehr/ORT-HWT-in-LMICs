Code for the paper "Prevalence, trends and socioeconomic inequality in coverage of oral rehydration therapy and household water treatment for childhood diarrhea. A cross-sectional study of nationally representative data from 5,202,093 adults in low-and middle-income countries"

This study includes individual-level data from 339 surveys, which are all publicly available. Data were used from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which are large, cross-sectional and nationally representative surveys, publicly available from the DHS Program website (https://dhsprogram.com/) and UNICEF MICS website (https://mics.unicef.org/surveys).

All analysis except the concentration index calculations were done in R version 4.0.5. The concentration index was calculated with the _conindex_ function in STATA 18.0
The analysis is done for five outcomes, three from the ORT dataset and two from the HWT dataset. All analysis were done separately for two time periods, 2000-2009 and 2010-2021
